# hello-world
A quick tutorial session. Will need to work on this again for Udacity.


Hello everyone! 

Kind of nervous starting this up so late. I am an idiot. Will need to work more efficently from now on. I am a little worried that my Python ability is not up to scratch, and that I will not finish my projects in time, but I need to put away that fear for now and just try to push on with this work. Over 7 months and almost no progress, because I keep terrifying myself. Keep telling myself that I will never pull this off. Well, time to try to prove my brain wrong. Here goes nothing!


## You will pull this off bc you are amazing, smart, and bad@SS!!!!!
